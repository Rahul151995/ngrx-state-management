# ngrx-state-management

State management is a very important part of web development. Sharing data between different components (especially with many separated ones) can be really difficult. Also, it ain’t easy to debug it when something goes wrong. Nowadays, we have so many libraries for state management, that it’s pretty tough to choose the right one.
